# unit-tests-for-tech-review
A bunch of very bad written unit tests for candidates


Make an interview to get a developer can be hard and test his skill can be difficult. You can ask him to develop some project ou explain some past project but this way, I think, you can't see his true knowledge of javascript. 
So I create this project : a bunch of unit tests which all failing, your candidate have to fix them (not all, after it's up to you).

# HOW TO START
- Run yarn test / npm run test (interview mode)
- Run yarn test_dev / npm test_dev (developer mode, this mode will only test tests updated)

# TODO
[] Display a wonderful page with nunjucks and express based on reports
